The ESP32 boards use the ESP-NOW protocol to communicate with each other, and some of the boards are also connected to a user&#39;s phone through Bluetooth. The code includes two functions:</p>\n<p> The broadcast function sends an ESP-NOW message containing data stored in the myData structure to every device in range.\n The receiveCallback function is called when an ESP-NOW message is received. It processes the received data, which is stored in the myData structure, and updates the state of the built-in LED. If a device is connected through Bluetooth, it sends a notification to the device by setting the value of a characteristic and sending a notification.\n In summary, the code facilitates communication between ESP32 boards using the ESP-NOW protocol and allows for the transfer of data and updates to the state of the devices.</p>\n<p> In summary, the code manages communication between a mesh network of ESP32 boards using the ESP-NOW protocol, as well as communication between individual ESP32 boards and a user&#39;s phone through a 1-to-1 Bluetooth connection. The code includes two functions:</p>\n<p> The broadcast function sends data stored in the myData structure to every device in the mesh network that is within range.\n The receiveCallback function processes incoming ESP-NOW messages and updates the state of the built-in LED. If a device is connected to a user&#39;s phone through Bluetooth, it sends a notification to the phone, allowing it to update the state of the mesh network.\n The code enables the mesh network of ESP32 boards to communicate with each other using the ESP-NOW protocol and allows a user&#39;s phone to keep the mesh network updated.</p>\n </details>"}
