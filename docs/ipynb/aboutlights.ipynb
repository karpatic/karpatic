    "In summary, The code is part of an Arduino sketch for multiple ESP32 boards. The ESP32 boards use the ESP-NOW protocol to communicate with each other, and some of the boards are also connected to a user's phone through Bluetooth. The code includes two functions:\n",

    "The broadcast function sends an ESP-NOW message containing data stored in the myData structure to every device in range.\n",
    "The receiveCallback function is called when an ESP-NOW message is received. It processes the received data, which is stored in the myData structure, and updates the state of the built-in LED. If a device is connected through Bluetooth, it sends a notification to the device by setting the value of a characteristic and sending a notification.\n",
