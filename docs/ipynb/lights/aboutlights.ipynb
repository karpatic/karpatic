    "In summary, The code is part of an Arduino sketch for multiple ESP32 boards. The ESP32 boards use the ESP-NOW protocol to communicate with each other, and some of the boards are also connected to a user's phone through Bluetooth. The code includes two functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "The broadcast function sends an ESP-NOW message containing data stored in the myData structure to every device in range.\n",
    "The receiveCallback function is called when an ESP-NOW message is received. It processes the received data, which is stored in the myData structure, and updates the state of the built-in LED. If a device is connected through Bluetooth, it sends a notification to the device by setting the value of a characteristic and sending a notification.\n",

    "guy on lighting board changing lights sends data to arduino via DMX shield. Arduino was INITIALLY connected to a laptop which would send data over wifi to main server which would send updates out via unicast to each of the badges in the concert hall. The central server would log every espthat connects to it for broadcasting.  The Server ran in a container enviornment (a prox box stack). This was later changed LIVE during the event because w 1.3k esp's the channel utilization for the wifi 2.4ghz band range shot up to 86% (dropped packets b/c of all the back and forth comms) before switching to send out raw 802.11 packets (espnow esque) via ESP's. 3 esps on 3 different broadcast channels would do the unicasting after being directly connected to the arduino (Cutting out the laptop and central broadcast server).
