    "\n",
    "### Why do we need it?\n",
    "> Many people's version-control method of choice is to copy files into another directory such as time-stamped directory if they are clever. This approach is common because it is so simple. However, it is also incredibly error-prone because it is easy to forget which directory you are in. Consequently, you could accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you do not mean to. The next major issue that people encounter is that they need to collaborate with developers on other systems. - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is it done?\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is where Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCSs) such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, and Darcs step in. In a DVCS, clients do more than check out the latest snapshot of files. They fully mirror the repository including its full history. If any server dies and these systems were collaborating via that server, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Every clone is really a full backup of all the data.  - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git"
