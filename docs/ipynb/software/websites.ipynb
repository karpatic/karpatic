    "## Design Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these General Summarized [Rules](https://anthonyhobday.com/sideprojects/saferules/):\n",
    "\n",
    "- General -> Put simple on complex or complex on simple\n",
    "- Layout -> Make outer padding the same or more than inner padding\n",
    "- Layout -> no hard divides unless it's an img divider\n",
    "- Buttons -> Make horizontal padding twice the vertical padding in buttons\n",
    "- Elements -> should go in order of visual weight (dark to light, fx to none, etc)\n",
    "- Element -> use multiples of '8'\n",
    "\n",
    "- Border -> Container borders should contrast with both the container and the background\n",
    "- Border -> For nested divs w rounded corners: interiorItemsRoundedBorder = xteriorspx - paddingpx\n",
    "- Border -> Make drop shadow blur values double their distance values. 4px on y = 8px blur\n",
    "- Border -> - closer z-index to camera = more light diffusion/ lower shadow opacity\n",
    "\n",
    "- Colors -> If you saturate your neutrals you should use warm or cool colours, not both\n",
    "- Colors -> Colours in a palette should have distinct brightness values, not just in hue\n",
    "- Colors -> bg should get lighter as the z-index increases\n",
    "- Colors -> The HSB brightness difference between background and container should be within 12%/7% for dark/light interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general...\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avoid Complexity: Sitemap links to nav pages which link to subject-related articles.\n",
    "- Jazz up section divides by by slapping atop a transform rotated div\n",
    "\n",
    "Reactive Explorative Interactive\n",
    "\n",
    "0. instead of interactive steppers, tabs, fixies, sliders, use scroll and multiples\n",
    "1. if you make the reader click or do anything other than scroll, something spectacular has to happen\n",
    "2. if you make a tooltip or rollover assume no one will ever see it.\n",
    "3. fewer small graphics embedded in articles and more stand-alone visual stories\n",
    "4. most visuals are static as a result\n",
    "5. if animation or motion is needed. trigger it on scroll\n",
    "\n",
    "more space between contrasts. more or same vertical padding than horizontal. Give each color a distinct brightness value. use near-white or black (f2f2f2 or 222 if you aren't saturating)\n",
    "\n",
    "- f2f2f2 is just 95% brightness\n",
    "- 222222 is just 13% brightness Saturate neutrals colors at least 5%. Layers get brighter.\n",
    "- +12% more for dark interfaces,\n",
    "- +7% for light interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "--canvas: hsl(0, 10%, 90%);\n",
    "--background: hsl(0, 80%, 90%);\n",
