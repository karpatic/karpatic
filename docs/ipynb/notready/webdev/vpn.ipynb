    "Notes from my 5 years in China: - Use a protocol like trojan-gfw over cloudflare. It 1: hides the fact that youâ€™re using a VPN and looks like normal https traffic, 2: Is open source and the Trojan-go/v2ray repositories are well tested in nightmarish environments like China. 3: Cloudfare obscures the IP address of your server from the government. - You can have your server use something like Mullvad so that your traffic blends into the crowd (of customers) - Always have an emergency protocol that is unlikely to get blocked. I wrote my own custom implementation of HTTPS over DNS for when they decide to cut off general internet access to sites outside the country. (Happens every month or so for a few days) - For messaging, use a fully open source & end to end encrypted & federated protocol that you can self host. Matrix.org is blocked in China but self hosting still allows you to contact people on the main server."
