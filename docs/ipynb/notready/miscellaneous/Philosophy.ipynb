    "Haldane suspected, along with Pirie, that a fully satisfactory definition of life was impossible, but he asserted that the material definition was a reasonable goal for science. He saw life as “a pattern of chemical processes. This pattern has special properties. It begets a similar pattern, as a flame does, but it regulates itself as a flame does not.” (Haldane 1947, p. 56). Use of the flame metaphor for cellular metabolic activity implied a nonequilibrium process in an open system capable of reproduction but also, by the limit of the metaphor, self regulation. In this Haldane reflected the shifting concern to working out how matter and physical laws could lead to biological phenomena.\n",

    "By the time of World War II it was meaningful to address the question of “what is life?” in molecular terms and fundamental physical laws. It was clear that there were several distinct ways in which matter in living systems behaved in ways different from non-living systems. For example, how could genetic information be instantiated at a molecular level given that ensembles of atoms or molecules behaved statistically? Or, how could biological systems generate and maintain their internal order in the face of the imperative of the second law of thermodynamics that all natural systems proceed with increasing entropy?"

    "Although conscious, living matter was a problem for Democritean philosophers, it was not for other pre-Socratics nor for Aristotle for whom living beings where paradigmatic. “The phenomenon which seemed to [Aristotle] most basic in the apparent flux of the world was the unity and persistence of the individual living being” (Smith 1976, p. 72). Indeed, Aristotle's biology and the philosophy he developed from it was sophisticated and enduring (Lennox 2001). Thus for Aristotle there was no problem of life, although there was a problem for an atomist view of nature that seemed inconsistent with biological phenomena (Rosen 1991). Descartes radically reconceptualized the problem by his dualism of matter and mind; life was a problem for which an explanation was to be sought in the mechanistic interactions of matter, and there was the question of how mind was related to the matter in living beings. As chemistry developed as a discipline in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the goal of most advanced thinkers was to develop explanatory theories of living things in terms of chemical matter and mechanisms. Such attempts at what must be admitted to be premature reduction were resisted by critics, including some vitalists, whose positions covered a wide range from romantic anti-materialists, through chemists seeking a new type of Newtonian force (“vital force”) in nature, to materialists who had an intuition of the importance of the organized whole (Fruton 1972, 1999).\n",

He rejects, however, the search for a vital force since it would reduce the complexity of biological phenomena to a single principle. Rather, the phenomena of biology can only be understood in a holistic perspective that is faithful to the complexity observed in biological phenomena."

    "Living systems then are seen an instance of a more general phenomena of dissipative structures. “With the help of this energy and matter exchange with the environment, the system maintains its inner non-equilibrium, and the non-equilibrium in turn maintains the exchange process…. A dissipative structure continuously renews itself and maintains a particular dynamic regime, a globally stable space-time structure” (Jantsch 1980). However, thermodynamics can deal only with the possibility that something can occur spontaneously; whether self-organizing phenomena occur depend upon the actual specific conditions (initial and boundary) as well as the relationships among components (Williams & Frausto da Silva 1999)."

    "Seeing the cell as a thermodynamic ‘dissipative structure’ was not to be considered as reducing the cell to physics, as Bernal pointed out, rather a richer physics of what Warren Weaver called “organized complexity” (in contrast to simple order or “disorganized complexity”) was being deployed (Weaver 1948). The development of this “new” physics of open systems and the dissipative structures that arise in them was the fulfillment of the development that Schrödinger foresaw (Rosen 2000). Dissipative structures in physical and chemical systems are phenomena that are explained by nonequilibrium thermodynamics (Prigogine & Stengers 1984). The emergent, self-organizing spatio-temporal patterns observed in the Belousov-Zhabotinski reaction are also seen in biological systems (such as in slime mold aggregation or electrical patterns in heart activity) (Tyson 1976; Sole and Goodwin 2000). Indeed, related self-organizational phenomena pervade biology (Camazine et al. 2001). Such phenomena are seen not only in cells and organisms, but in ecosystems, which reinforces the notion that a broader systems perspective is needed as part of the new physics (Ulanowicz 1997). Important to such phenomena are the dynamics of non-linear interactions (where responses of a system can be much larger than the stimulus) and autocatalytic cycles (reaction sequences that are closed on themselves and in which a larger quantity of one or more starting materials is made through the processes).

Such an approach non-reductively connects the phenomena of living systems with basic laws of physics and chemistry (Harold 2001)."

    "7. Conclusions\n",
    "Our increased understanding of the physical-chemical basis of living systems has increased enormously over the past century and it is possible to give a plausible definition of life in these terms. “Living organisms are autopoietic systems: self-constructing, self-maintaining, energy-transducing autocatalytic entities” in which information needed to construct the next generation of organisms is stabilized in nucleic acids that replicate within the context of whole cells and work with other developmental resources during the life-cycles of organisms, but they are also “systems capable of evolving by variation and natural selection: self-reproducing entities, whose forms and functions are adapted to their environment and reflect the composition and history of an ecosystem” (Harold 2001, 232). Such a perspective represents a fulfillment of the basic dual insights of Schrödinger near mid-century. Much remains to be elucidated about the relationships among the complex molecular systems of living entities, how they are constrained by the system as a whole as well as by physical laws. Indeed, it is still an open question for some as to whether we have yet a sufficiently rich understanding of the laws of nature or whether we need to seek deep laws that lead to order and organization (Kauffman 2000). At the start of the new century there is a sense of the importance of putting Schrödinger's program into a ‘systems’ context ( see for example Rosen 1991, 2000; Kauffman 1993, 1995, 2000; Depew and Weber 1995; Weber & Depew 1996, 2001; Ulanowicz 1997, 2001; Williams and Frausto da Silva 1999; 2002, 2003; Harold 2001; Morowitz 2002; Bunge 2003; Macdonald and Macdonald 2010). Significant challenges remain, such as fully integrating our new view of organisms and their action with evolutionary theory, and to understand plausible routes for the emergence of life. The fulfillment of such a program will give us a good sense of what life is on earth. Work in A-Life and empirical work seeking evidence of extra-terrestrial life may help the formulation of a more universal concept of life."
