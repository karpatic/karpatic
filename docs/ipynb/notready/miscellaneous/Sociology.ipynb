    "According to Planck one proton can contain a thousand trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion bits of information. 10 to the power of 66. This would be a very tiny black hole and the information could not escape. It has long been believed that all the information in the universe began the size of a mustard seed or even smaller. Information can not be lost. Even if you erase a hard drive that information still exists as energy. IBM can currently store one bit of information on one atom. That means there are enough atoms in the human body to contain all the information on the internet around 20,000 times over. So we currently can fit all the information on the internet in a tea spoon. You can fit all the DNA of the human race in a Teaspoon. Using our existing technology. Anything the size of a molecule only has an on and off, there is no way to modify it."

The Singapore Institute of Materials Research in 2011 increased the amount of data used on hard drives by 6 times and we'll soon see that commonly available making our \"normal\" about 166 hundred thousand atoms per bit\n",
    "However, we have a long way to go though. The human genome is about 1GB of data (3 billion nucleotide base pairs). DNA is 2 nanometers in diameter and 3.4 nm per wind. If you do the math here you get about 10^18 bytes per cubic centimeter or a billion billion bytes (not bits). Since 1 inch is 25.4 mm, that's 10^22 or ten billion billion bytes per cubic millimeter which is 10 zetabytes in a single cubic mm of DNA. Scary small.\n",

    "But it goes beyond that even. It is possible to store many bits per atom and even electron. In 2009 researchers at Stanford announced they were using a brilliant scheme of reading interference patterns between carbon-monoxide atoms on top of copper atoms. Because this uses the electrons to produce interference patterns and multiple patterns can be stored at different electron frequencies, it is more like a hologram and they have named this electronic quantum holography. It also means you can store more than one bit using a single electron. Here there were storing 35 bits per electron. Source: Reading the fine print takes on a new meaning. Again this takes an STM so don't expect this in your laptop anytime soon."

    "For decades, psychological research has been able to explain procrastination as a functioning problem, not a consequence of laziness. When a person fails to begin a project that they care about, it’s typically due to either a) anxiety about their attempts not being “good enough” or b) confusion about what the first steps of the task are. Not laziness. In fact, procrastination is more likely when the task is meaningful and the individual cares about doing it well. "
