Html renders first, then css, and then js. ((( Near all JS [frameworks](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/current.html) are over 15kb compressed. That's before even using it! )))\n",

    "- The use of IPYNB's also means I can publish exploratory analysis's effortlessly. Special tooling (((There are lots of python libraries that spit out or export javascript. To name a few: Plotly, ObservableHQ, [dataplay](https://github.com/BNIA/dataplay) (A mapping library I made using leaflet), and more! )))means the output can even be interactive online!
