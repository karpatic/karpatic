Made for 3d printing. Not a powerful PCB design tool. Used to play around with a virtual Arduino or build and simulate a virtual prototype of an analog circuit. As an added bonus, you can use its 3D modeling features to design the enclosure. This easy-to-use tool runs in your web browser. It uses Boolean Modeling to make objects using shapes as building blocks. Combine or subtract the basic shapes to create more complex designs. Really one of the more mature and fantastic 3D modeling software platforms that is robust and easy to approach, even for kids and beginners. isn’t quite in line with the team’s goals of keeping everything free and open. Although it was briefly in danger of going out of business, it was bought by AutoDesk who have made a lot of improvements. It is possible to program and simulate an Arduino in the same tool — which always strikes us as an odd juxtaposition. supports https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/codeblocks\n","\n","\n","Blender and Sketchup are not CAD apps. They are polygonal modelers and as such cannot produce accurate and suitable models for CNC milling or laser cutting. True CAD software either use CSG (outdated) or boundary representation (B-Rep). All modern CAD software use B-Rep, and so does FreeCAD. BRL-CAD, works but its modeling method is constructive solid geometry (CSG), which is very limited, and this almost 30-year old program has a very ancient GUI.\n","\n","1. Autodesk ( Eagles / Fusion 360 ) - EAGLE-Fusion integration - Although it’s not free to use (students can obtain a free license) anymore, Eagle is the defacto standard for many when it comes to circuit capture and PCB layout.  after being bought by Autodesk the software has been updated, and now works seamlessly alongside all of Autodesk’s other products such as Fusion360. 3D Renders of your PCB are now possible, and you can import the render into Fusion360, or Inventor to design the housing in which the PCB will reside. This is a handy feature for companies or individual who has already subscribed to other Autodesk products. Fusion 360 is remains free under the following conditions: If you are a student, you can try it free for up to 3 years. If you are a hobbyist or a small business (under $100,000), you can try it for free for 1 year after the initial 30-day trial expires. Fusion360 is a desktop 3D modeling program that uses cloud computing to assist with heavy computational loads like simulations. Beyond 3D modeling, it also includes workspaces for 3D sculpting (labeled Create Form in the software), sheet metal fabrication, rendering, animation of assemblies and operations, manufacturing with CNC machines and lathes, and simulations of static and nonlinear stress, thermal stress, structural buckling, and shape optimization. There’s a lot going on under the hood of Fusion360, so it’s intended for more experienced users, or at least those aspiring to become more experienced users.\n","\n","\n","2) EasyEDA is a free, zero- install, cloud-based EDA tool, designed to give electrical engineers, educators, engineering students and electronics hobbyists an Easier EDA Experience. It is easy to use circuit design, circuit simulator and PCB design that runs in your web browser. supports open source parts libraries. import PCB and Schematic files from popular CAD programs like Eagle. circuit simulator \n","\n","3) FreeCad -  It turns out that early work on the project was done in the web-based TinkerCAD, which isn’t quite in line with the team’s goals of keeping everything free and open.
