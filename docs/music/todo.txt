Request all from table
create h1 with dropdown button to change genre
on change, it displays major award winners in that genre 
and updates caption text which loads other awards

clicking an artist loads a search for the artist, clicking song loads the song.

initialize a function that is behaves like a flag but contains an array
create a function thats called inside onstatechange 
change flag state depending if the function needs to happen before a new song starts playing

remove variable from the flag after the song id has been added to list of playing
