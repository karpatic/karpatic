    "\n",
    "Principally, a data scientists job is to apply scientific methods to data in a process often refered to as data-mining. The purpose of this mining is to find informative patterns in the data and to then make meaningful /actionable knowledge of said information. Often times the exploration of the data and development of something actionable is accompanied Machine Learning Algorithms. While [contentious](https://priceonomics.com/whats-the-difference-between-data-science-and/), Statistics is generally understood as more focused on quantative descriptions of data and that data science grew out of statistics as an applied branch of the field with an emphasis on  qualatative data and actionability of their output.

Early methods of identifying patterns in data include Bayes' theorem (1700s) and regression analysis (1800s)... **Data mining is the process of applying [machine learning] methods with the intention of uncovering hidden patterns.**[[16]](https://archive.org/details/dataminingconcep0000kant) in large data sets.

However, the term data mining became more popular in the business and press communities.[14] Currently, **the terms data mining and knowledge discovery are used interchangeably.** [data-mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining)"

    "2. **Explore** - (Data Understanding) find extremes, range within, distributions, anomolies, etc. Performed after any data processing is done. \n",
    "3. **Pre-process** - Cleaning the data for further analytical activities and exploration by filtering or performing non-critical prep work on the data like removing noise or missing vals or meet size/time limit constraints. Typically only done once.\n",
    "4. **Process** - Once the raw data is cleaned and generically prepped, additional transformational processes may be required to make applicable use of data for a scientific specific model. augmentations may include sorting, filtering and arranging, and aggregating and integration. Many different models and precesses may be used, each deserving an exploration.\n",
    "5. **Model** - test train predict, regressions, clusterings, etc. Analysis is performed by applying models on data and recording the output, Includes finding Correlations, and aontextualize any discoveries. \n",
    "6. **Act** - Inteperite the data and draw evaluative conclusions and communicating them in the form of something presentable/ actionable.\n",

There are thought to be 6 meta-physical cascading layers of meta-data that expand onto themselves indefinetely. When humans perform their superficial observation about the world around them, at that 'instant' all the data and its accompanying meta-data is 'metabolized' by our sensory processors solely at the 'instance' level of this Hierarchy. Illicitation of further understanding of the data may be derived by critically introspecting into the observation.

    "- **Spread** - Common measures of [statistical dispersion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_dispersion) are the [standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation), [variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance), [range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(statistics)), [interquartile range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range), [absolute deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_deviation), [mean absolute difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_difference) and the [distance standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_standard_deviation).
