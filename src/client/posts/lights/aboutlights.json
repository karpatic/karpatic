The code includes two functions:\n <br><br></p>\n<p> The broadcast function sends stored data to every device in the mesh network that is within range.\n It also processes incoming ESP-NOW messages and updates the state of the built-in LED. If a device is connected to a user&#39;s phone through Bluetooth, the device will send notification to the phone and recieve back commands, allowing it to update the state of the mesh network.\n <br><br></p>\n <p>Possible Kits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>USB 2.0 + 3 light meters  (2.1a can drive 35 LED using 60ma)</p></li>\n<li><p>USB 3.0 + 5 light meters </p></li>\n<li><p>2x 18650 (3.7v, 25a, 3k mah each) </p></li>\n<li><ul>\n<li><p>Battery Holder, JST 2 DC switch w JSTv2 2 light</p></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>lifepi4 - 2100mah 6.6v </p></li>\n<li><ul>\n<li><p>JST2Light <br></p></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n </details>"}
