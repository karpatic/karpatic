# Hi there Cryptovoxels team! ðŸ‘‹

I am Carlos Karpati, 27 years old, resident of Bethesda, Maryland. I have an MS in information systems from UMBC (May 2020).  

I see that you are in need of a react/node developer and I want to let you know that I am your ideal candidate!

A self-taught programmer who started at the age of 14, for the past 5 years I worked as a full stack developer (Vanilla or React, Webpack+Node, Python) at a non-profit in Baltimore City. While there, I created and disseminated quality of life indicators from disparate administrative datasets for the benefaction of the cities inhabitants and community-based orgs. A process that existed for 13 years and once took 3 people the better part of a year to do has since been automated. Every one of the last three mayors have directly credited our works in their victory speech for their better understanding of the city. Brandon Young, the current mayor, went so far as to spend a full day in our office on the first day of his job.

As a self-support unit, my organization took on countless odd jobs and development contracts with neighborhood organizations to create bespoke data-intense web products to further analyze, enmesh, and visualize community data. This consisted of created a bevy of novel features and a lot of working with react and node, see references [1](https://geoloom.org), [2](https://bniajfi.org/bold/), [3](https://bniajfi.org/greenpatterns/). forewarning: The data sharing agreement has expired on the last 2 of those links; rendering some functionality defunct. Being the sole developer for the entire outfit, a lot was riding on my ability to perform - and I did. 

One of my favorite contracts was given to us by the U.S. National Science Foundation where I was given the opportunity to  teach data science at the University of Baltimore to graduate students. Subsequently, I have created numerous tutorials covering a wide array of technical concepts, see references [4](https://github.com/BNIA/dataplay), [5](https://github.com/BNIA/VitalSigns), [6](https://github.com/BNIA/dataguide), [7](https://github.com/BNIA/datalabs). I take pride in my work, and all my tutorials are accompanied by open-source resources published on pypi and npm. I have a passion for helping others was also deeply involved in mentoring data-science interns, developing software to assist internal operations, and in the process of  cleaning, analyzing, and processing geospatial data.

Since finding CV, I have enjoyed all it has to offer. The space has provided me with an outlet to explore new technologies, make new friends, and develop my interpersonal and professional skills. I am passionate about the things I do, and after having made myself redundant as of November at my old job, it is with great fortune that I have been recognized within my new community and found a sponsor whom will allow me to continue my work full-time in CV; by building out it's infrastructure through advanced parcel-script use cases. You may or may not have seen me in the discord forums sharing my many developments, or answering people's miscellaneous questions. At the moment I do also take on contract developments as I work towards creating my own in-world video game company (https://www.cvminigames.com), but everything I do is open-source and always has been.

Thank you for reading this far down; I really do appreciate it as working for Cryptovoxels would be like a dream come true.

Should you have any questions or concerns, I am only a text away: 301-300-4728 (or charles.karpati@gmail.com or via Twitter [@CVMiniGames](https://twitter.com/CVMiniGames)).

I look forward to hearing back from you!

Kindly, 

Carlos

Below you will find a few more samples of my work:

- Anything hosted on my current employer's [GitHub](https://github.com/bniajfi) account
- A react-based [website generator](https://github.com/bnia/bniabuilder) I built to create data-intensive applications
- A [stripped-down](https://github.com/3Diot/template_webpacked_capacitor) version of the generator I use for miscellaneous projects (such as this midi reprogramming [tool](https://charleskarpati.com/stomp/))

- And the video below is of a website I made that communicates analyzed music data to an IOT Mesh network via Web Bluetooth (compiled with node):

- My [ObservableHQ](https://observablehq.com/@karpatic?tab=notebooks) account has code that converts geodata into interactive SVG's and 3D printable models (shown below) and has since been used to created 3d printable version of the CV islands:

- I have much more stuff that is private (ML, Stonk, and crypto-projects) and we may talk about all that if you are interested.

Double thank you for reading this far down!

Twice kindly,

Carlos Karpati
