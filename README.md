# Hi, ðŸ‘‹

I am Charles Karpati, 27 years old, resident of Bethesda, Maryland. I have an MS in information systems from UMBC (May 2020).  

Presently I teach data science at the University of Baltimore, and have created numerous tutorials covering a wide array of technical concepts, see references [1](https://github.com/BNIA/dataplay), [2](https://github.com/BNIA/VitalSigns), [3](https://github.com/BNIA/dataguide), [4](https://github.com/BNIA/datalabs). I am also a full stack developer (Vanilla or Webpack+Node, Python) for a non-profit organization in Baltimore City, where I create and disseminate quality of life indicators (Python and JS). I take pride in my work, all my tutorials are accompanied by open-source resources published on pypi and npm. I do this to help others in the non-profit sector with data processing, creation, and visualization. I am also mentoring data-science interns, developing software to assist internal operations, and to clean, analyze, and process geo-spatial data. I started programming when I was fourteen, I enjoy the cyber and social aspects of it all. I am passionate about the defi community, and have made a decision to pivot my career towards building out the it's infrastructure.

Below you will find a few samples of my work:

- Anything hosted on my current employer's [github](https://github.com/bniajfi) account
- A [website generator](https://github.com/bnia/bniabuilder) I built to create data-intensive applications
- A [stripped-down](https://github.com/3Diot/template_webpacked_capacitor) version of the generator I use for miscellaneous projects ( such as this midi reprograming [tool](https://charleskarpati.com/stomp/))

- And the video below is of a website I made that communicates analyzed music data to an IOT Mesh network via Web Bluetooth:

- My [ObservableHQ](https://observablehq.com/@karpatic?tab=notebooks) account has code that converts geodata into interactive SVG's and 3D printable models (shown below):

- I have much more stuff that is private (ML, Stonk, and crypto-projects) and we may talk about all that if you are interested.

Sincerely, Charles.
