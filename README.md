# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am Carlos Karpati, 28 years old, resident of Bethesda, Maryland. I have an MS in information systems from UMBC (May 2020).  

I see that you are in need of a react/node developer and I want to let you know that I am your ideal candidate!

A self-taught programmer who started at the age of 14, I spent 5 years after undergrad working as a full stack developer (Vanilla or React, Webpack+Node, Python) at a University of Baltimore institute that works to make city-government data accessible to the public. While there, I created and disseminated quality of life indicators from disparate administrative datasets for the benefaction of the cities inhabitants and community-based orgs.

As a self-support unit, the BNIA-JFI organization took on countless jobs with neighborhood organizations to create bespoke data-intense web products to further analyze, enmesh, and visualize community data. Through this, I have ammased extensive experience working with react, node, and webpack. see references [1](https://geoloom.org), [2](https://bniajfi.org/bold/), [3](https://bniajfi.org/greenpatterns/). More examples are provided below. Being the sole developer for the entire outfit, a lot was riding on my ability to perform - and I did. As a forewarning: expired data sharing agreements means some functinality on the above links are now defunt.

One of my favorite contracts was given to us by the U.S. National Science Foundation where I was given the opportunity to  teach data science at the University of Baltimore to graduate students. Subsequently, I have created numerous tutorials covering a wide array of technical concepts, see references [4](https://github.com/BNIA/dataplay), [5](https://github.com/BNIA/VitalSigns), [6](https://github.com/BNIA/dataguide), [7](https://github.com/BNIA/datalabs). I take pride in my work, and all my tutorials are accompanied by open-source resources published on pypi, npm and github. I have a passion for helping others and have been deeply involved in mentoring, consulting, and developing software to assist internal operations. I do these things not just at a professional capacity, but also for fun.

Since finding CV, I have enjoyed all it has to offer. The space has provided me with an outlet to explore new technologies, make new friends, and develop my interpersonal and professional skills. I am committed to the things I set my mind on and act with conviction, accordingly. It is with great fortune to be recognized within the CV community and to have found someone who will sponsor my work full-time; building out CV through advanced parcel-script use cases. As a side note, I am in good terms with my previous employer and may be called upon at some point in the future to assist with maintanance. These days you can find me in the CV discord forum sharing my developments, and or helping answering people's many questions. I also take on contract developments and have been working towards creating my own in-world video game company (https://www.cvminigames.com). Everything I do is open-source and always has been. Should you feel me not a right fit for the job or invaluable in my plac as it stands perhaps there are other ways we may work together.

Thank you for reading this far down; I really do appreciate it as working for Cryptovoxels would be a dream.

Should you have any questions or concerns, I am only a text away: 301-300-4728 (or charles.karpati@gmail.com or via Twitter [@CVMiniGames](https://twitter.com/CVMiniGames)).

I look forward to hearing back from you!

Kindly, 

Carlos

Below you will find a few more samples of my work:

- Anything hosted on my current employer's [GitHub](https://github.com/bniajfi) account
- A react-based [website generator](https://github.com/bnia/bniabuilder) I built to create data-intensive applications
- A [stripped-down](https://github.com/3Diot/template_webpacked_capacitor) version of the generator I use for miscellaneous projects (such as this midi reprogramming [tool](https://charleskarpati.com/stomp/))

- And the video below is of a website I made that communicates analyzed music data to an IOT Mesh network via Web Bluetooth (compiled with node):

- My [ObservableHQ](https://observablehq.com/@karpatic?tab=notebooks) account has code that converts geodata into interactive SVG's and 3D printable models (shown below) and has since been used to created 3d printable version of the CV islands:

- I have much more stuff that is private (ML, Stonk, and crypto-projects) and we may talk about all that if you are interested.

Double thank you for reading this far down!

Twice kindly,

Carlos Karpati
